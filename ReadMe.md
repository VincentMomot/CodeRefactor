Horiseon Refactoring

Description: For this assignment, I was tasked with refactoring Horiseon's webside to make it more accessable and consolidate the code while not changing the overall appearance.

Changes I made:
1) I concolidated the CSS formatting to pertain to multiple elements instead of describing each individually.
2) I added alt tags to the images in case the link to the image is broken
3) I changed the <div> tags to provide more information in the HTML code
4) I commented the CSS code to make it easier to know what is happening if the code is ever worked on again
5) I completed multiple Git Pushes to keep a working file accessable while I was editing the document
6) Added a README.md to describe the work
